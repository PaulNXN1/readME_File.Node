# readME_File.Node

## Description
This is the UPenn Module 9 Assignment. The student was tasked to create a README generator.
Basic startup javascript code was provided to each student, and with that code, the student was tasked to create code in order to populate a README file by using the commandline, or terminal [with node.js].  

When the program runs in the terminal, the user will be prompted with questions that will create "answers" that will autopopulate the README file.  

The end result will create a file, called "sample.md" - which the user can use as a README.  


## Code Contributors
The project was completed by Paul Nixon, student.  No group work was completed.  


## User Story
Pre-written code was provided to the student. The main goal was to implement and practice the use of node.js, and inquirer, which will be use to take data inputted by the user to create the README file.  


## Acceptance Criteria
The assignment is complete when all aspects of the UPENN Module #9 Acceptance Criteria points are met.  The developer [Paul Nixon] has reated a text document that confirma all criteria points were met.  The document is called 'criteria.txt', which is available in the repository.
